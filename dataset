I am planning on using three data sets in my final project. All three of them come from Kaggle.
The first data set is Student Alcohol Consumption. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption
The reason I chose this data set was because it has a lot of information on deomographics and how they are linked to alcohol consumption in students aged 15 to 22.
The second dataset I am using is Groundhog predictions. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/groundhog-predictions?select=groundhogs.csv
This dataset shows whether the groundhog predicted 6 more weeks of winter or an early spring each year.
The last dataset I am using is Employee Seperation Forecast. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marquis03/employee-separation-forecast?select=test_noLabel.csv
This data set shows people in different fields, what their satisfaction levels were, their distance from work, and other factors to understand what the trend is with 
people who decide to quit their jobs or not.
